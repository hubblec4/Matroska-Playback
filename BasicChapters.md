# Matroska Basic Chapters
A basic chapter uses only the start time and the chapter name.
If the chapter is invisible or disabled then no data from this chapter will be used.
The chapter times should be in ascending order in the Matroska file. If this is not the case then the chapter times have to be sorted.
